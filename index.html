    <h2>Plot licence expiration counts</h2>
    <iframe src="bar_plot.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: This plot visualizes the count of licenses expiring each year, categorized by their status (e.g., Active, Not Renewed). Users can select a specific year using a slider to see the distribution of license statuses for that year.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Choices</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encoding Types</strong>: The x-axis represents the license statuses, and the y-axis represents the count of licenses. The bars are colored by license status to differentiate between them.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Scheme</strong>: The color scheme is categorical, with different colors representing different license statuses. This choice was made to easily distinguish between the statuses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Data Transformations</strong>: The 'Expiration Date' column was converted to a datetime format, and a new column 'Expiration Year' was extracted to facilitate filtering by year.</p>
    <p><strong>Interactivity</strong>: A slider was added to allow users to select a specific year. This interactivity helps users focus on the data for a particular year and makes the visualization more dynamic and informative.</p>
